Flataculties, an app where you can vote for the cutest animal:)
## The Pet Heaven

## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to vote for their favorite animals. It displays a collection of animal cards, each containing the animal's name, image, vote count, and a button to increase the vote count. Users can click on an animal's name to view additional details about the animal.

The application utilizes JavaScript and interacts with a RESTful API to retrieve and update data. It makes use of the Fetch API to perform HTTP requests to the backend server. The server stores the animal data and provides endpoints for fetching all animals, updating vote counts, and resetting vote counts.

The frontend code is built with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. It uses `DOM manipulation` to dynamically render the animal cards and handle user interactions such as voting and resetting vote counts. Event listeners are attached to the vote and reset buttons to perform the corresponding actions.

The code also includes a `form submission` functionality. The form captures user input from various input fields and creates an object representing the form data. This object is then sent to the server using a POST request.

Overall, this project provides an interactive and engaging user experience for voting on favorite animals. It demonstrates the use of frontend technologies, API integration, and data manipulation in a web application context.
